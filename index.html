                                During the project, I conducted field research, including interviews and surveys, and created the user flow, 
                                wireframes, and user tests.  
                                I also designed the app’s logo and illustrations.</h4>

                                The page includes animations: Van Gogh’s hand moves, and the cursor is his ear, adding a playful and creative touch to the experience.</h4>
